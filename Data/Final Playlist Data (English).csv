You've been good, busier than ever. We small-talk, work and the weather. Your guard is up and I know why. Because the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind. You gave me roses and I left them there to die. So this is me swallowing my pride, Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night,"" And I go back to December all the time. It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you. Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine. I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right. I go back to December all the time. These days I haven't been sleeping, Staying up, playing back myself leavin'. When your birthday passed and I didn't call. And I think about summer, all the beautiful times, I watched you laughing from the passenger side. And realized I loved you in the fall. And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind You gave me all your love and all I gave you was ""Goodbye"". So this is me swallowing my pride, Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night."" And I go back to December all the time. It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you. Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine. I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind. I go back to December all the time. I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile. So good to me, so right. And how you held me in your arms that September night: The first time you ever saw me cry. Maybe this is wishful thinking, Probably mindless dreaming, But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right. I'd go back in time and change it but I can't. So if the chain is on your door I understand. But this is me swallowing my pride, Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night."" And I go back to December. It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you. Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine. I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
